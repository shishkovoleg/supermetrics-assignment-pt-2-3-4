Would you use a class/library provided by an external framework in your code, why or why not?

If this class/library is framework agnostic and can be used in our project we can use it with some extra conditions.
- If it's one class, it's not a big issue and can be easily added to our project.
- If it's a library we should check how popular it is, because if it's not maintained properly we will have to
take this responsibility and maintain this library.
  
In opposite cases I don't recommend to use class/library provided by an external framework since cons outweigh pros.
